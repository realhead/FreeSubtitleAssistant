This is your best assistant to rename video and subtitle file names. 

We all come into this situation which video and subtitle names are not match, then we have to drag subtitle file into player every time, again and again. FreeSubtitleAssistant is a free, simple, quick, light software to solve this problem.

You can easily cover file names from LEFT list (source list) to RIGHT list (destination list), just be ware don't mess up the direction (from left to right).

Currently, only 64bit version on Win OS available.
